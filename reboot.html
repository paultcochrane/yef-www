   title = 'Reboot Perl Conference organization in Europe'
%]

<p>After 15 years of work, the current YEF setup is not working to well anymore. Therefore, we would like to invite all people who want to continue to have informative, fun, cool (and maybe slightly crazy) Perl conferences and events in Europe to join us.</p>

<p>At the <a href="http://act.perlconference.org/tpc-2018-glasgow/">Perl conference in Glasgow</a> we had an open meeting ("Bof") where we discussed these issues and came up <a href="https://domm.plix.at/perl/2018_08_conference_orga_bof.html">with a lot of great ideas</a>. After some further YEF-internal discussion, I boiled it down to this mission statement:</p>

<h2>The mission</h2>

<p><strong>Assembly a group of people who are interesting in
(and capable of) organizing Perl events in Europe; define tools we can
use; share our knowledge; so we can continue to have great Perl Events,
with a focus on "the conference previously known as YAPC".</strong></p>

<h2>The Plan (as of now)</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Invite interested people (happening right now!)</li>
  <li>Spend a few weeks bootstrapping, discussing the goals and what tools we want use to reach those goals (during September)</li>
  <li>Set up tools (beginning of October)</li>
  <li>Start with the proper work (mid October)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Your action is required!</h2>

<p>If you want to join, please subscribe to the <a href="https://lists.yapceurope.org/mailman/listinfo/venue">YEF Venue mailinglist</a> via the web interface or by sending a mail to <a href="mailto:venue-join@yapceurope.org">venue-join@yapceurope.org</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that we will start with the proper work only after 2018-09-17, so we can give new members time to subscribe!</p>

<p>Looking forward to some interesting discussions followed by productive work,<br/>
domm (Thomas Klausner)</p>
