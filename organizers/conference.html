On this page you will find an overview of the selection process
and proposal, <a href="#walk">an example of the application process</a>, and
a list of
<a href="#tips">things to consider when writing an application</a>.
</p>
<p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
As noted on the <a href="[% organizers_page %]">organizers' page</a>,
the YAPC::Europe conference is the single annual event where YEF is 
involved.  The <a href="[% venues_page %]">venue committee</a> is   
made up of both YEF board members and other previous YAPC::Europe
organizers.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="[% venues_page %]#schedule">annual schedule</a> gives
some indication of important dates related to the process.  The call
for proposals is published both in the YEF 
<a href="[% news_page %]">news section</a> as well as on a number
of Perl-related sites.  This announcement is authoritative concerning
the actual deadline for proposals. 
</p>

<p>
Some 
<a href="http://tpf.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/yapc/YAPC.pm">documentation 
for conference organizers</a> is available, but may not be completely
up-to-date.  We recommend that you 
<a href="[% old_proposals_page %]">review previous proposals</a>
to see what has been submitted in the past.  Submissions 
<strong>will be added to the website</strong>.  Please abide by the
following guidelines when crafting a proposal:
<ul>
<li>Write the proposal in plaintext or HTML.</li>
<li>Provide contact information, including phone numbers
    and email addresses, for all conference
    organizers. Organizers are expected to be part of the Perl community,
    i.e. members of a local <a href="http://pm.org">Perl Mongers Group</a>.</li>
<li>Specify if there is any part of the proposal which you do not wish to
    be made public (contact information will be automatically withheld from
    publication).</li>
<li>We would rather not receive venue endorsements as this has the potential
    to divide the Perl community over the choice of venue.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Walking through an application</h2>
</a>
This section provides an example of how the application process proceeds.
Pisa's application for 2010 was selected as an example because the organizers
did not ask that any part of the document (other than personal contact
information) remain confidential.  Thus it is one of the most complete
proposals available.  
Pisa was also chosen 
as an example because the group previously provided an account of the
<a href="[% workshop_stories_page %]">2008 Italian Perl Workshop</a>,
which provides the opportunity for experienced workshop organizers to see
the differences and similarities between YAPC::Europe and a workshop.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Statement of Intent</h3>
On April 13, 2009, the Pisa group sent an email to the venue committee
informing the committee that they would be submitting a proposal.
While this notification is not required, it allows the venue committee
to make personal enquires as the deadline nears if the proposal has not
yet been submitted.  On one occasion, the venue committee was able to
offer a short extension to a group which had previously expressed interest
(such an offer is only extended under rare circumstances).  The notification
also serves as a safeguard against the application not being delivered; if
the venue committee expects an application and does not receive it, the
committee will attempt to contact the group.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Application</h3>
On June 30, 2009, the Pisa group emailed their 
<a href="[% old_proposals_dir %]/2010/Pisa.html">application 
to host YAPC::Europe 2010</a> to the venue committee.  The venue committee
responded with a confirmation.  Because YAPC::Europe 2009 was going to
take place in early August rather than mid- or late August, the committee
expressed its intention to compress the
<a href="[% venue_page %]#schedule">normal consideration schedule</a>.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Follow-up Questions</h3>
On July 6, 2009, the venue committee sent a 
<a href="[% old_proposals_dir %]/2010/Pisa_questions.html">list of
questions</a> to the Pisa group.  These questions addressed parts of
the application which weren't understood, or issues which were not covered
by the application.  Some questions are always asked, while others might
be inspired by areas covered by the other proposals received.
Here are some questions which are commonly overlooked:
<ul>
<li>What type of power outlets are available (voltage, frequency, and
    plug type)?</li>
<li>How much does beer cost?</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
On July 10, 2009, the Pisa group
<a href="[% old_proposals_dir %]/2010/Pisa_answers.html">responded
with answers to the venue committee's questions</a>.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Evaluation</h3>
The venue committee used the information provided by the candidate groups, as
well as information from other sources (such as personal knowledge of
the city/country, accounts of workshops held in the country, and general
sources of information) in order to evaluate the proposals.
Each committee member used her or his personal experience from having
organized a conference to weigh the importance of the different aspects
of the proposals.  The venue committee discussed the strengths and
weakness of the proposals before casting votes to select a venue.
</p>
<p>
The decision is always a complicated one, in part because the venue
committee must balance two different objectives when selecting a location.
One goal is to have a conference
which the attendees enjoy and which meets or exceeds the standards of
previous conferences.  YAPC::Europe is also intended to stimulate local
Perl organizations and to bring new people into the Perl community.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Notification</h3>
On July 20, 2009, the venue committee sent emails to all groups which
had submitted proposals informing them of the decision.  The YEF treasurer
contacted the winning group about the 
<a href="[% organizers_page%]#conferences">kickoff donation</a>.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Public Announcement</h3>
At <a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/">YAPC::Europe 2009 in Lisbon</a>, 
it was 
<a href="[% news_page %]#20090803">publically announced</a>
that Pisa would host YAPC::Europe 2010.

<h2>Tips</h2>
</a>
<div class="titled_list">
<dl>
<dt>Boosting your application</dt>
<dd>
<li>Teams with experience in organizing other events, such as workshops,
    can more easily convince the committee that they have the skills to 
    organize a conference.</li>
<li>Teams should be members of the Perl community. We will not consider
    applications submitted by commercial event organizers with no ties
    to the Perl community.
<li>Photos and/or videos of the venue are always recommended, as they 
    allow the committee to get a better feel for the space.</li>
</dd>
<dt>Important considerations</dt>
<dd>
<li>Be aware of other events taking place in the city.  Large
    conferences or festivals can drive up hotel prices or even claim
    all accommodation.  Even events which aren't widely publicized
    (such as professional association meetings)
    have this potential, so inform yourself by speaking with a city
    authority. </li>
<li>It is impossible to overstate the importance of the network.  
    No matter how good the conference is, if the internet connectivity
    isn't good, that is what attendees will remember.  Many
    venues will claim to have sufficient wireless nodes, but are
    calculating for perhaps one in three people to be online at any given
    time.  Ask for specific figures rather than trusting assurances from
    the venue or vendor.</li>
<li>Likewise, the number of power sockets available is important, as
    people will want to charge their laptops.  Inspect the number of
    power outlets in the different rooms (as well as the hall), and 
    determine to what extent you can safely increase the number of 
    outlets through extension cables.  Be sure there is an outlet
    near the stage for the speaker.  Try to look not only at the
    number of outlets, but the breakers behind them; is the wiring
    modern enough to support the usage it will get during a conference?
    This is another area where you are advised to investigate for yourself,
    rather than trust the venue's assurance that "everything will be
    fine."</li>
<li>Make sure that your budget is realistic, given the economic climate.
    Be certain to distinguish between essential components, optional
    components, and 'nice to have' extras.</li>
</dd>


<dt>Promotion</dt>
<dd>
<li>Promotion is becoming an increasing part of YAPC::Europe, so take the
    time to list your skills.  If you have media contacts, that's wonderful.
    If you have designed a promotional video, include the link.  Explain
    how you will promote the conference to people who have never attended
    a Y::E, and tell us how you will make sure they are included in the
    experience.</li>
</dd>
<dt>Flexibility</dt>
<dd>
<li>It is worth having some idea of alternative venues in case your
    first choice venue doesn't work out.</li>
<li>If there is any area of the application where you are flexible, mention
    it.  For instance, you might specify a date when you expect to hold
    the conference, but if you have alternative dates, suggest them. If
    the venue committee has a problem with a particular aspect of the 
    application, it's possible that they may believe it to be fixed
    and not think to ask if it can be altered.</li>
</dd>
<dt>Remember diversity</dt>
<dd>
<li>Consider how accessible your venue is to wheelchair users, people with
    hearing difficulties, and those with other types of limitations.  
    It's important that Y::E try to be open to everyone who wants to
    attend.  Furthermore, you should ensure that people with disabilities
    will have a similar experience at the conference.  For instance, if
    someone in a wheelchair cannot can only sit in one place, apart from
    other attendees, she or he may not be able to engage in the social
    aspects of the conference, or may have difficulty seeing or hearing
    the speaker.  Keep such issues in mind with all locations (i.e. the
    conference dinner, if there is one), not just the conference 
    location.</li>

From wikipedia article which is linked:

A lacto-ovo-vegetarian is a vegetarian who does not eat beef, lamb, pork, poultry, fish, shellfish or animal flesh of any kind, but is willing to consume dairy and egg products.

In the Western world lacto-ovo vegetarians are the most common type of vegetarian. Generally speaking, when one uses the term vegetarian a lacto-ovo vegetarian is assumed. 
-->
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacto-ovo_vegetarianism">Lacto-ovo 
    vegetarians</a> are a large enough minority that meal plans should
    include options for them.  It is also worth considering that people
    may have other dietary restrictions (for instance vegan or gluten-free), 
    but these are probably best offered 'on demand' as the number of people
    requiring special meals is likely to be small.  If you honestly cannot
    meet someone's request with a reasonable amount of effort, be certain
    that the attendee is aware of this problem.</li>
<li>In recent years there have been some regrettable incidents within the free
    and open source communities which have led to some people feeling
    excluded or offended.  
    Conference organizers should carefully consider whether any
    content (including speeches and advertising) is liable to be viewed as
    sexist or otherwise offensive by attendees.</li>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</p>
<p>
Remember, just because something's been done before doesn't mean you have to do
it again, unless it is something attendees expect.  Over the years
YAPC::Europe has grown and changed, which wouldn't have happened if
organizers hadn't had new ideas about how to do things!
