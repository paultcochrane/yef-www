YAPC::Europe Foundation is pleased to announce
that Riga, Latvia has been chosen as the site for the
Perl Conference in Europe 2019.
</p><p>
This is the second time the conference comes to Riga and 
we are confident that Riga's experienced team — which was responsible
for several Perl workshops in a number of different countries, including
two YAPC::Europe — will put together a wonderful conference.
The theme for the next YAPC::Europe will be 'Make Perl great again'.
</p><p>
The main conference days are
7-9 August 2019. The conference website will be launched soon.
Meanwhile you can follow the 
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/tpconf.eu/">conference page on Facebook</a>.

Born to Perl in 1999 for his job, he met the French Perl Mongers
in 2004 for the 1<sup>st</sup> French Perl Workshop.<br />
He started grenoble.pm right after that but failed in making it
a successful Perl Monger Group.<br />
After moving to Paris, he joined paris.pm, became Treasurer of the
French Perl Mongers, organized several French Perl Workshop and
was involved in OSDC.fr (a cross-language yearly conference).
</p>
<p>
He has a single module on CPAN (in the Acme:: namespace).
While he is organizing parties for Mongers, while he is counting
again and again the money of the French Perl Mongers, he's not
writing any single line of Perl.
