Instructions to create a local YEF website from the repo.

# Download the yef website repo.
$> git clone https://github.com/yapceurope/yef-www/

# Change location.
$> cd yef-www/

# Build the site
$> make site
or
$> ttree  -a -v -l LIB -f .ttreerc -s . -d /tmp/yef

# View the local site in Firefox
$> make show-site

# Alternatively, point your browser at the newly created (local) site directly
$> firefox file:///tmp/yef/index.html

# Not sure why, but on my box, all links point to /home/yapc/public_html
# (explanation welcome), so I had to link to this location explicitly.
$> ln -s /tmp/yef/ /home/yapc/public_html

# The fully functional site is now here:
$> firefox file:///home/yapc/public_html/index.html
